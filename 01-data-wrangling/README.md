Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather related datasets from different sources and formats, assess their quality and tidiness, and perform the necessary cleaning.
In this project, you will document your data wrangling process in a Jupyter Notebook and showcase your efforts through analyses and visualizations using Python and its data-focused libraries.
