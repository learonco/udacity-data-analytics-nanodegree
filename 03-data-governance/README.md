Project Steps Overview
1. Create an Enterprise Conceptual Model that provides a holistic view of data in these three systems.
2. Design the draft version of the Enterprise Data Catalog by documenting the metadata in an Excel spreadsheet.
3. Profile the data to identify 3 data quality issues. Create a document that lists each data quality issue, its description, and a suggested remediation strategy for each.
4. Design a data quality dashboard that will report on the issues you’ve identified above plus at least 1 more issue that you foresee might occur in the future.
5. Based on what you’ve read about SneakerPark’s systems and business model, sketch out a proposed MDM implementation architecture, and write a detailed explanation of why you chose this specific approach.
6. You will define a set of matching rules that will be used by SneakerPark's MDM Hub to match item and customer entities between the company's different systems.
7. Write a paragraph discussing what data governance roles and responsibilities will be necessary to oversee this new Data Management initiative.
